            <p>Hello! I am Edwin Bartlett, 18 years old, from Bohol,
            Philippines. I was born in the UK and lived in the Philippines for
            more than 10 years. I've always been a tech enthusiast
            interested in coding, ever since I was young. I also like playing
            certain instruments like the ukulele and guitar, and I also enjoy
            playing video games with friends. I am currently an incoming
            college IT student studying at University of San Carlos, and I wish
            to improve my coding skills as I go on. I hope I can create websites and
            programs that would help and provide entertainment to people around the world.</p>
